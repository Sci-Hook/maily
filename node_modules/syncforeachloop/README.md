syncForEach is a synchronous version of the forEach loop. 

In the example below, each of the cities is printed on the screen.

## Install

To install the package via npm, run the following code in the terminal:

`$ npm i syncforeachloop`

## Usage

For JavaScript:
```js
const {} = require('syncforeachloop');
```

For TypeScript:
```ts
import 'syncforeachloop'
```

### Examples

```js
var cities = ["Paris","İstanbul","Berlin"]; //Defined an array of cities.

//Each variable will be assigned to a single city variable.
cities.syncForEach(function (city,next_city,index,length) {
    console.log(index); // Index will be written to the console.
    console.log(length); //Array length (array element count) will be written to the console.
    console.log(city); //Each city will be written on the console.
    next_city(); //This function will skip to the next element.
});
```
In the example below, shows the use of callbacks.

```js
var cities = ["Paris","İstanbul","Berlin"]; // Defined an array of cities.

// Each variable will be assigned to a single city variable.
cities.syncForEach(function (city,next_city,index,length) {
    console.log(index); // Index will be written to the console.
    console.log(length); // Array length (array element count) will be written to the console.
    console.log(city); // Each city will be written on the console.
    next_city(); // This function will skip to the next element.
},() => { // Calling a callback function after elements in all arrays are complete.
    console.log('Loop Ended');
});
```

In the example below, shows the use of callbacks from outside.

```js

function callback() {
    console.log('hello');
}

var cities = ["Paris","İstanbul","Berlin"]; // Defined an array of cities.

cities.syncForEach(function (city,next_city,index,length) {
    console.log(index);
    console.log(length);
    console.log(city); 
    next_city(); 
},callback); // It is possible to call a function from outside.
```
